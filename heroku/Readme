Run the Heroku CLI in a container.

Instructions

1. Copy bin/heroku into your $PATH somewhere.
2. Put your Heroku API key in $HOME/lib/heroku-key.
(Find your API key at https://dashboard.heroku.com/account.)
3. Run "heroku apps"!

This gives the command minimal access to your system,
so it can't do helpful things like add git remotes,
or infer app names. It also has no memory between
invocations, so even "heroku login" doesn't work.
(That's why you have to save your API key by hand.)
